-----superDead-----

Back in the 1930s, there was a web developer working for Al Capone.  This web developer built the supply chain management software for Capone's liquor smuggling operations.  One day a software bug, a bug that could have easily been caught by testing, led to the loss of 3 truckloads of Capone's bootlegged booze.

superDead is a unit testing framework for JavaScript.

-----Notes-----

- I started this project because I...
  - wanted to see if I could build a Jasmine/Mocha clone (it turns out I can!)
  - had never built a project using Node.js, so this was an excuse to do that
  - wanted to get more experience with JavaScript testing
  - wanted more experience writing JavaScript outside of a Rails project
- This project has not yet been used by me in another application

-----Usage-----

- To run tests, run this from root directory => node testHelper.js
